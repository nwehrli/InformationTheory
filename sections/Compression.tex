    {Definition - Code} 
    A code \(C\) is a mapping from outcomes to codewords
    \[C: \{1, ..., m\} \to \{0, 1\}^*\]
    \begin{itemize}[label=-]
        \item If there is no codeword that is a prefix of another codeword, the code is a \textbf{prefix code}. 
        \item Prefix codes retain injectivity when concatenating codewords.
    \end{itemize}
\end{mainbox}
Sets of codewords fulfilling the prefix property can be uniquely represented by the leaves of a binary tree. 
Since a leaf node has no children the prefix property is guaranteed.

\begin{mainbox}
    {Kraft's Inequality}
    If \(\{c_1, ...,c_m\}\) are codewords of a prefix code, then 
\begin{align}
    \sum_{x}2^{-l_x} \leq 1, \text{ where }l_x = |c_x|
\end{align}
Conversely, given \(\{l_1, ..., l_m\} \subset \N\) satisfying (3), there exists a prefix code with those codeword lengths.
\end{mainbox}
